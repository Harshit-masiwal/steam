"As a competitive BGMI esports player who has faced top Indian esports organizations like Soul, GODL, and RNTs, 
Iâ€™ve experienced firsthand what drives player engagement and game success. Leveraging this domain knowledge,
I analyzed over 27,000 Steam games to uncover actionable insights on pricing, playtime, achievements, and genre performance. 
This project bridges real-world gaming experience with data science to identify the factors that make a game truly successful, 
providing valuable guidance for developers, publishers, and the gaming community."
